## TODO
TODO:
1. Visualize indication of the timer for the app (use of radial gradients and shadows)
2. Add a timer to the app
2. Styled typing in the text box
3. I am thinking of an animation of let's say it blinks all of the cards and ends at the card that is selected
4. Add a button to reset the game

## About the Game

Grid Waldo challenges your attention and memory with a quick-reflex game mechanic:

- A 3×3 grid of images is displayed
- At the start of each round, one image gets a brief highlight (just 1 second!)
- Your task: identify which image was highlighted
- Wrong guesses are disabled and tracked in a side panel
- Perfect for party play on large screens where everyone can point and discuss

## Features

- Clean, Quizlet-inspired UI with soft shadows and rounded cards
- Minimal design keeps focus on the gameplay
- Wrong guesses remain visible but dimmed to track progress
- Simple text input for guessing
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## How to Play

1. Watch carefully when a new round starts - one image will briefly flash
2. Type your guess in the text input field
3. Submit your answer
4. Continue until you find the highlighted image or run out of guesses
